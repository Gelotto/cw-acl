# CosmWasm ACL
This is a generic CosmWasm smart contract implementing an Access Control List that other smart contracts can query to determine whether the sender of a transaction is allowed to execute a specified action or access a specified resource. You can associate arbitrary principals (e.g. account addresses or app-specific ID strings) with path names that represent said actions and resources. You can also create _roles_, to which you can authorize paths. From there you can grant roles to principals as a means of inheriting authorization to the paths with which the roles are associated. 

## Building & Local Deployment
Just run `make build`. To deploy to a local juno dev node, [see instructions here](https://docs.junonetwork.io/developer-guides/junod-local-dev-setup). After starting the node, you can run `make tag=<tag> deploy`, where `<tag>` is the name for the build. The default tag is `dev`. the `deploy` Make target will create a local directory `./builds/build-dev`, containing the optimized WASM generated by `make build` along with a text file with the Code ID returned by the local dev node resulting from the deployment.
